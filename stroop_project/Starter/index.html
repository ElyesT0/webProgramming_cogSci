      === Step 1: Understanding the Structure ===
      This experiment is designed to test the Stroop effect.
      Find the following elements on the page :
      - A "Start" button to begin the experiment.
      - A canvas area where the word and buttons will appear.
      - A fixation cross ("+") shown before each trial.
      - Four colored buttons for responses.

        The <head> part of an HTML file defines some key parameters about the display of the page. 
        This particular file:
        - Sets the character encoding to UTF-8 for proper text display.
        - Ensures mobile responsiveness with the viewport meta tag.
        - Loads the Axios library for sending experiment data.
        - Links to an external CSS file for styling.

            === Javascript integration ===
           Usually we write the javascript at the bottom of the HTML Page, in the <body> element. 
            Keep in mind that the order of the lines of code is critical for sources in <script> tags, as they will be 
              executed in the specified order.
            So previous scripts should be independent of subsequent scripts.

    <!-- Script to handle data posting to a server -->
